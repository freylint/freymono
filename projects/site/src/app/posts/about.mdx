This is a site that was created after five separate prototypes far too complex
to be maintained by a developer who can't seem to get themselves to study web
development for a long period. Welcome to my reject project, my own personal
Unix. The acceptance that I'll never want to maintain a web of microservices for
a page that contains the tech writing a person who has spent over five years
coding, with nothing resume worthy to take from it.
