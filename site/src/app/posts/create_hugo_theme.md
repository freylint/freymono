Today is Valentine's Day, so I decided to spend most of it with my girlfriend.
The time I did spend at my computer was creating some of the
formatting tools for for devblogs/devlogging.
This will be my first devlog outside of a jupyter notebook,
so this will be an interesting project.

...

So that was a lie. I ended up sitting down to create my new theme.
Pimeja, From the [Toki Pona] word for black.
The aim of the theme is to create a dark mode theme focused around
the emotional reponse of the Helvetica typeface.

Today was a hard day at work. My new job, outlined [in my lifechanging reddit post blog]({{<relref "./lc_reddit_post.md">}})
has me counting the minutes to the end of the day. While I'm sure this is quite normal, I need to focus on learning
to cope with my current situation before I can make significant headway on this project.
My mental stack seems to be constantly occupied by anxiety and feelings of dread.

Making progress on this project has been a struggle. I've just gotten my first two day weekend in almost a month, but I'm
coming off of missing commits for two days in a row and morale is low. Hopefully I'll be able to get some work done on this tomorrow.

I've had a long week at work. Working 48 hours a week only getting an hour or two of personal time each week.
I'm starting to question if I have the time to be able to work on a custom site solution like this.
Maybe I would be better off slapping something together in Wordspress or something.

I get to sit down and work on the project today! My goal for today is to iron out some user stories for this project.

They are:
- [As a desktop user of this website, I want the content exist in a readable column so that I can comfortably read them.](https://github.com/freylint/freyground/issues/7)
- [As a desktop user of this website, The content should be on a slightly lighter background than the gutter, so I can focus better on the content.](https://github.com/freylint/freyground/issues/8)
- [As a user of this site, there should be a topbar to make a consistent cannonical navigation, so that I can get around the site.](https://github.com/freylint/freyground/issues/9)
