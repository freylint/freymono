_note: this is a first draft of this article._

I recently got a fancy new job in IT. Most people would celebrate this, but it
seems to punctuate my actual desire to become a programmer even more. I spend
all day working on the periphery of systems I want to crack open like one of
those [Japanese candies you have to assemble yourself].
I spend all day reflecting on my shortcomings. My every shortcoming laid bare
like an anime fight scene set to a soundtrack of commercial-grade PC speaker
test tones.

So I made a Reddit post:

If you're like the commenters, You'll read a sense of dejection, determination, and desperation.
I don't particularly like my day job consisting of gruntlike computer refurbishment duties.
I'm at least lucky enough to not be one of the people who were flexible enough at the beginning
to have gone around to all of these non-secure roles in the facility.
I need to get out, but my life is spent on the pure development of skills.
Value delivered for me and no one else.

So where do you go from here? I have ~4 months left on a contract.
Acknowledging this, I have 4 months to apply the advice in this reply:

While some of this advice is fairly easy to implement, like having daily GitHub activity and contributions to large
projects whose name people in dev will recognize. I find myself struggling to implement the piece of advice that
`u/factoryremark` advised was important for your first "in" to an industry.
At this point I believe I can talk the talk, but what do you do when you can't find anyone to talk to.
The problem isn't this simple either. In order to talk to people I have to find those people.
How do you find programmers in the middle of IT Town, Ohio?
Asking around I've found some people who've done programming work in the past,
but they all have to have an air of dismissal and warding. Like Gandalf, if they couldn't be bothered to learn your name.

How do I meet other programmers in my local area?
This will have to be a question I'll reflect on regularly.
It seems I have more trouble finding other programmers than I do finding dates.
This will be an interesting problem.
